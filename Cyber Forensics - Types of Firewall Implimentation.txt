---------------
A firewall is first line of defense to protect IT infrastructure from any malicious attack. Firewalls broadly classified into two types: software and hardware firewall. Software Firewalls generally used in your personal desktops while hardware firewalls generally deployed at data centers and corporate offices. 


List of Network Firewall Practices:-
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Default deny all network traffic and allow only ports and services which are required.
2. Must have written organization’s security policy and implement the same while doing firewall configuration.
3. Run the Firewall service as a unique user id instead of the administrator or root privilege.
4. Change default passwords for firewall devices. Also, change it periodically and take care of password strength.
5. Never rely on packet filtering. Use other filtering techniques to protect IT infrastructure from malicious attack.
6. Filter packet based on source and destination addresses.
7. Control physical access to the firewall. This is obvious but should be strictly followed.
8. Patch the firewall’s operating system and application software to get the vendor’s specific update.
9. Use network firewalls internally for segment networks. Also, implement a firewall to satisfy an organization’s security policy.
10. Conduct security test against firewall regularly and correct it on any issue.
11. Always use a secure remote syslog server. It helps to prevent manipulation of logs by a malicious attacker.
12. Consider managed service provider for firewall management to get expertise in the field of firewall management services.
13. Use change management practices for a network firewall. Document everything on changing any configuration.
14. All desktops should run a personal firewall in the network. This act as an extra layer of security if your desktop or laptop using public wifi and more susceptible to attack.
15. Regularly backup the firewall rule-base and configuration files in read-only backup devices.
